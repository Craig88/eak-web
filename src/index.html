                        <p>Children learn languages quickly and easily, so why not teach them the real languages of
                            technology?</p>
                        <p>E.A.K. is a story-driven game that provides children with knowledge of both computational
                            thinking and professional coding languages, to efectively prepare them for 21st Century degrees
                            and careers.</p>

                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                        <p>Girls and boys aged 8+ learn to code by building and fixing real levels as they play - on their
                            own, or alongside parents or teachers.</p>
                        <p>As E.A.K. progresses, children will learn how to use their new HTML, CSS and Javascript skills to
                            build their own simple creations on the web. The game currently teaches HTML syntax, and once
                            purchased it will be updated regularly.</p>

                        <h2>Our story</h2>
                        <p>Whilst it’s a known fact that learning to code will give children a huge advantage in their
                            careers, the vast majority still believe that this subject area is “too difficult” and “more for
                            boys”.</p>
                        <p>Erase All Kittens was made in 2014, by an advertising creative, a developer, and an illustrator.
                            The challenge was to come up with a new and exciting way to inspire children - especially girls
                            - to code and create on the web.</p>

                        The team worked together every evening and weekend for six months, before being accepted onto Emerge Education - an accelerator aiming to improve educational outcomes worldwide.
                        They received further funding and used this to carry out extensive research whilst developing E.A.K. They also met some brilliantly talented people along the way, some of whom joined their team and board of advisors.
