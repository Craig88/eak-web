                Children learn languages quickly and easily, so why not give them an advantage by teaching them the real languages of technology?

                Erase All Kittens is a pioneering game that makes it fun and easy for children to learn about <strong>professional coding languages</strong>,
                whilst supporting their intellectual and creative development.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Girls and boys aged 8+ can learn to code by building and fixing real levels as they play - on their own, or alongside parents
                or teachers. As E.A.K. progresses, children will learn how to use their new HTML, CSS and Javascript skills
                to build their own simple creations on the web.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The game currently teaches HTML syntax, and if purchased will be updated regularly.

                E.A.K.’s goal is to provide every child with knowledge of both computational thinking and professional coding languages to
                effectively prepare them for 21st Century degrees and careers.

            <h2 class="kinda-important">Why we created E.A.K.</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Since technology is increasingly affecting every aspect of our lives, it’s now essential for every child to learn about code
                - the language of computers. However, although it would give them a huge advantage in their careers, many
                children believe that this subject area is ‘too difficult’ and ‘more for boys’.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Existing tools and games teach students about computational thinking using a programming language called Blockly, made especially
                for kids. However, although this is a great introduction to coding, it is undeniably very different to building
                creations on the web using the same languages as professional developers.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Erase All Kittens was made at the start of 2014, by an advertising creative, a developer, and an illustrator. The challenge
                was to come up with a new and exciting way to inspire children - especially girls - to code and create on
                the web using professional coding languages.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The team worked together every evening and weekend for six months, before being accepted onto Emerge Education in 2014 -
                an accelerator aiming to improve educational outcomes worldwide. They received further funding and used this
                to carry out extensive research whilst working on E.A.K. full-time for two years. They also met some brilliantly
                talented people along the way - some of whom joined their team and their board of advisors.

            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The Erase All Kittens team have worked on a CBBC series called The Dengineers and were recently selected as one of the most
                exciting startups globally, by Pioneers 500. The game has been exhibited at Mozilla’s Mozfest, Web We Want
                Festival, Maker Faire, The Education Show, BBC’s Make it Digital Tour, CoderDojo events and Code Clubs, and
                will soon be showcased at BETT Futures on 25 - 28 January 2017.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                E.A.K.s long-term mission is to equip every child with the practical skills necessary for them to create on the web. The
                team are also extremely passionate about inspiring girls to code and create, so that they can grow up to
                have the same opportunities as boys.
