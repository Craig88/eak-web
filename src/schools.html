                E.A.K. is pioneering as unlike other code education products, it teaches both computational thinking and professional coding
                languages e.g. HTML syntax. The new learning tool supports students in building up their Personal Learning
                and Thinking Skills which are crucial for lifelong success in learning. E.A.K. has been shown to inspire
                students to become researchers, teachers, problem solvers, team builders, writers and designers, as well
                as coders.

            <p class="lead">
                E.A.K. also allows teachers to become facilitators of independent learning, since it encourages collaboration and is highly
                engaging to students aged 8-14.
