            <p>E.A.K. is pioneering as unlike other code education products, it teaches both computational thinking and
                professional coding languages, e.g. HTML syntax. The new learning tool supports students in building up
                their Personal Learning and Thinking Skills, which are crucial for lifelong success in learning.</p>

            <p>The game has been shown to inspire students to become researchers, teachers, problem solvers, team
                builders, writers and designers, as well as coders.</p>

            <p>E.A.K. also allows teachers to become facilitators of independent learning, since it encourages
                collaboration and is highly engaging to students aged 8-14.</p>
