                E.A.K. is pioneering as it teaches programming in a real-world, creative context. This learning tool helps students build
                up personal learning thinking skills which are crucial for lifelong success in learning. E.A.K. is designed
                to inspire and encourage students to become researchers, teachers, problem solvers, team builders, writers
                and designers, as well as coders.
