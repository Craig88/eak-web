          E.A.K. is unique because it teaches children professional coding languages, as well as building up skills vital for future success, like creativity, critical thinking and independent learning.

            Players need to build the game as it goes along by changing its source-code - written in HTML, CSS and Javascript - so that they can rescue kittens in a fantasy internet universe. Computing terms such as ‘URLs’ are also explained, through engaging and interactive dialogue.

      As E.A.K. progresses, kids aged 8+ will learn how to create real websites and apps, whilst building up skills that will directly help to prepare them for the new digital era.

            E.A.K. is designed to appeal to both girls and boys. We have 40,000 players around the world, solely through word-of-mouth, and 46% of them are girls. 
This game will provide an easier and more efficient method of teaching the KS1 and KS2 computing curriculum, due to a very high level of engagement, and built-in tools for assessment.

          E.A.K. currently teaches HTML, and if purchased will be updated regularly. Our mission is to encourage and equip children with skillsets which will enable them to be creators, rather than consumers in our increasingly digital world.
