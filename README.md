# Erase All Kittens
[E.A.K.](http://eraseallkittens.com/) is a new open source game that teaches kids to code and create on the web. Levels are written in `HTML` and `CSS`, but most are impossible until you hack in to them and modify their source code.

The story of E.A.K. is that cute animals on the Internet hate kittens, because they get all the views. They form the evil operation E.A.K. - Erase All Kittens. You must use your coding super powers to save the kittens, and consequently the entire Internet.

## Try it online
We have an *early* demo you can play at [http://eraseallkittens.com/](http://eraseallkittens.com/).

## Team & project
E.A.K. is designed and built in London by [Drum Roll](http://drumrollhq.com). We're something between a games company and an ed-tech startup, and we're huge fans of the Open Web.

The aim of the project is to teach kids real, practical coding skills. After playing the game, we want people to be able to build and publish their own creations on the web.

If youâ€™re interested in what we've done so far or would like to help out, we'd love to hear from you. Fill out the form on [our website](http://eraseallkittens.com/), and we'll get in touch. If you just want to dive straight in and checkout the code, read on :)

## Installing

This one's pretty simple.

Make sure you've got Bower and Npm installed, do a 

`bower install` and a 
`npm install`.

## Building
Also, you'll need to make sure that you've got gulp installed and accessible globally, then you can run 
`gulp serve` in the terminal and it should start the site at `localhost:4010`
